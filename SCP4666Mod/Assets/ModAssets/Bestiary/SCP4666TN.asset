    Sigurd''s danger level: A++


    Scientific name:
    SCP-4666


    It seems that scp 4666 has taken a liking into visiting moons
    and abducting kids, he seems to only target people who have witnessed him kidnapping
    a child, if he is not seen he will not attack, but as soon as someone does see
    him he will start chasing them to the end of the earth to kill them, or if they
    are a child kidnap them, he is wielding a kind of magical knife he can throw
    and recall as he pleases, he does also seem to use a kind of teleport ability
    to confuse his target or to follow them into buildings.


    It does seem that
    it is possible to take him down with enough force, if someone is lucky or skilled
    enough to take him down they will find his magical knife, and his bag full of
    kids, they might be useful in case of emergencies.


    SCP 4666 is a lethal
    keter class and should be avoided at any cost -Dr.Emilia'
